# Sticker Snatcher
A very simple plugin that allows you to right-click and copy or save stickers.

Stickers are automatically converted to `.png`. Animated stickers may not display properly in Discord chats as regular images but they still retain their animated behavior.

Discord-made stickers can't be downloaded for DMCA reasons.
